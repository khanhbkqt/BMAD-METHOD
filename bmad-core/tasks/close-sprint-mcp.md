# Close Sprint Task (MCP Enhanced)

## Purpose

Systematic sprint closure process that reviews goal achievement, analyzes completed work, captures lessons learned, and prepares for the next sprint. This ensures continuous improvement and proper sprint lifecycle management.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE

**MANDATORY SPRINT CLOSURE**: Before starting a new sprint, the current sprint must be properly closed with goal assessment and retrospective analysis.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Verify Current Sprint Status

**Sprint Status Check:**

1. **Get Current Sprint:** Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to verify active sprint:
   - If no active sprint: Display message "No active sprint to close" and exit
   - If active sprint exists: Proceed with closure process

2. **Sprint Timeline Check:** Verify sprint completion:
   - Check if sprint end date has passed
   - If sprint is ending early: Ask user for reason and confirmation
   - Display current date vs planned end date

### 1. Sprint Goal Achievement Analysis

#### 1.1 Goal Assessment

**Sprint Goal Review:**

1. **Display Sprint Information:**
   ```
   üèÉ SPRINT CLOSURE REVIEW üèÉ
   
   Sprint: ${sprint_name}
   Goal: ${sprint_goal}
   Duration: ${start_date} to ${end_date}
   Planned Stories: ${planned_story_count}
   ```

2. **Goal Achievement Evaluation:** Ask user to assess:
   ```
   Sprint Goal Achievement Assessment:
   
   Original Goal: "${sprint_goal}"
   
   Goal Achievement Level:
   1. Fully Achieved (100%) - Goal completely met
   2. Mostly Achieved (75-99%) - Goal substantially met  
   3. Partially Achieved (50-74%) - Goal partially met
   4. Minimally Achieved (25-49%) - Goal barely met
   5. Not Achieved (0-24%) - Goal not met
   
   Please select level and provide explanation:
   ```

#### 1.2 Story Completion Analysis

**Sprint Backlog Review:**

1. **Get Sprint Tasks:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` with sprint filter:
   - Query all tasks assigned to current sprint
   - Count completed vs planned stories
   - Identify incomplete stories

2. **Completion Metrics Display:**
   ```
   üìä SPRINT COMPLETION METRICS üìä
   
   Stories Completed: ${completed_count} / ${total_count}
   Completion Rate: ${completion_percentage}%
   
   Completed Stories:
   ${list_completed_stories}
   
   Incomplete Stories:
   ${list_incomplete_stories}
   ```

3. **Incomplete Story Handling:** For each incomplete story:
   ```
   Incomplete Story: ${story_title}
   Current Status: ${current_status}
   
   Action for this story:
   1. Move to next sprint (recommended)
   2. Mark as completed (if nearly done)
   3. Cancel/remove from backlog
   4. Keep in current sprint (extend sprint)
   ```

### 2. Sprint Retrospective

   - [New tool/technique 2]
   ```

### 3. Sprint Metrics and Learning Capture

#### 3.1 Sprint Velocity Calculation

**Performance Metrics:**

1. **Calculate Sprint Velocity:** Use completion data:
   ```
   üìà SPRINT VELOCITY METRICS üìà
   
   Stories Completed: ${completed_stories}
   Sprint Duration: ${duration_weeks} weeks
   Sprint Velocity: ${stories_per_week} stories/week
   
   Historical Comparison:
   Previous Sprint Velocity: ${previous_velocity}
   Velocity Change: ${velocity_change} (+/- ${percentage}%)
   ```

2. **Velocity Trend Analysis:**
   - Is velocity increasing, decreasing, or stable?
   - What factors influenced velocity changes?
   - What does this suggest for future sprint planning?

#### 3.2 Documentation Creation

**Sprint Closure Documentation:**

1. **Create Sprint Review Document:** Use `bmad_create_document`:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "sprint-review",
     "title": "Sprint ${sprint_num} Review - ${sprint_name}",
     "content": {
       "sprint_info": {
         "name": "${sprint_name}",
         "goal": "${sprint_goal}",
         "duration": "${start_date} to ${end_date}"
       },
       "goal_achievement": {
         "level": "${achievement_level}",
         "explanation": "${achievement_explanation}"
       },
       "completion_metrics": {
         "planned_stories": ${planned_count},
         "completed_stories": ${completed_count},
         "completion_rate": "${completion_percentage}%",
         "velocity": "${sprint_velocity}"
       },
       "retrospective": {
         "went_well": ["${item1}", "${item2}", "${item3}"],
         "improvements": ["${item1}", "${item2}", "${item3}"],

       },
       "incomplete_stories": ["${story1}", "${story2}"],
       "lessons_learned": "${lessons_text}"
     }
   }
   ```

### 4. Sprint Status Update and Closure

#### 4.1 Handle Incomplete Stories

**Story Transition Management:**

1. **Process Incomplete Stories:** For each incomplete story:
   - Update story status if moving to next sprint
   - Add notes explaining why story wasn't completed
   - Estimate remaining effort for next sprint planning

2. **Use MCP Tools for Updates:**
   ```json
   bmad_update_task_status:
   {
     "task_id": "${story_id}",
     "status": "TODO",
     "notes": "Moved from Sprint ${current_sprint} - ${reason}",
     "sprint_id": null
   }
   ```

#### 4.2 Close Sprint Officially

**Sprint Closure Process:**

1. **Update Sprint Status:** Use `bmad_update_sprint_status`:
   ```json
   {
     "sprint_id": "${current_sprint_id}",
     "status": "COMPLETED",
     "end_date": "${actual_end_date}",
     "goal_achievement": "${achievement_level}",
     "completion_rate": "${completion_percentage}%",
     "velocity": "${sprint_velocity}",
     "lessons_learned": "${retrospective_summary}"
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Closure:** Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to confirm:
   - Sprint status changed to COMPLETED
   - No longer shows as current/active sprint
   - All data properly recorded
