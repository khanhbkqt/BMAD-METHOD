# BMAD Method: Comprehensive Workflow and Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

The BMAD (BMad-Method) is a Universal AI Agent Framework implementing "Agentic Agile Driven Development" - a revolutionary approach that eliminates planning inconsistency and context loss through a sophisticated two-phase development methodology:

1. **Agentic Planning Phase**: Specialized agents create detailed PRDs and Architecture documents
2. **Context-Engineered Development Phase**: Development agents work with hyper-detailed, self-contained stories

This analysis covers the complete BMAD ecosystem, including its agents, workflows, document management, task orchestration, and context retrieval mechanisms.

---

## 1. Core Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Framework Philosophy

BMAD implements a **scope-based sprint philosophy** that fundamentally differs from traditional Agile:
- **No time constraints**: Sprints are scope containers, not time-boxed iterations
- **No capacity planning**: No story points, velocity, or team capacity
- **Context containers**: Used to provide focused context and priorities to AI agents
- **Work boundaries**: Define scope of work for AI agents to operate within

### 1.2 Directory Structure

```

```

### 1.3 Core Configuration System

The `core-config.yaml` provides centralized project configuration:

```yaml
markdownExploder: true        # Enable document sharding
prd:
  prdFile: docs/prd.md
  prdSharded: true
  prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architecture:
  architectureFile: docs/architecture.md
  architectureSharded: true
  architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
devLoadAlwaysFiles:          # Files always loaded by dev agents
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
devStoryLocation: docs/stories
```

---

## 2. Agent System Architecture

### 2.1 Agent Definition Framework

Each agent is defined using a hybrid markdown-YAML format containing:

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Human-readable name"
  id: "unique-identifier"
  title: "Professional title"
  icon: "ðŸŽ­"
  whenToUse: "Usage guidance"

persona:
  role: "Professional role"
  style: "Communication style"
  identity: "Core identity"
  focus: "Primary focus area"

commands:
  help: "Show available commands"
  task: "Execute specific task"

dependencies:
  tasks: [list-of-task-files]
  templates: [list-of-template-files]
  checklists: [list-of-checklist-files]
```

### 2.2 Core Agent Types

#### 2.2.1 Orchestrator Agent (`bmad-orchestrator`)
- **Role**: Master coordinator and transformation interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic agent transformation (`*agent {name}`)
  - Workflow guidance and selection
  - Command processing with `*` prefix requirement
  - Lazy loading of resources (only when needed)

#### 2.2.2 Planning Phase Agents

**Analyst Agent**
- Creates project briefs through brainstorming and research
- Performs market research and competitor analysis
- Generates initial project scope and requirements

**Product Manager (PM)**
- Creates comprehensive PRDs from project briefs
- Defines functional and non-functional requirements
- Structures epics and user stories
- Uses `prd-tmpl.yaml` template with advanced elicitation

**UX Expert**
- Creates front-end specifications from PRDs
- Generates AI frontend prompts (v0, Lovable integration)
- Defines UI/UX design goals and interaction paradigms

**Architect**
- Creates system architecture from PRD and UX specs
- Defines technical stack, data models, API specifications
- Provides coding standards and project structure
- Uses `fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml`

**Product Owner (PO)**
- Validates all artifacts using `po-master-checklist`
- Shards documents into manageable pieces
- Coordinates document consistency

#### 2.2.3 Development Phase Agents

**Scrum Master (SM)**
- Creates detailed stories from sharded epics
- Uses `create-next-story` task for context consolidation
- Manages story lifecycle and status

**Dev Agent (James)**
- Implements stories using `develop-story` command
- Works with self-contained story files
- Updates only Dev Agent Record sections
- Follows strict context isolation principles

**QA Agent**
- Reviews implementations using `review-story` task
- Performs refactoring and code quality checks
- Updates story status from Review to Done

### 2.3 Agent Transformation System

The orchestrator implements dynamic agent transformation:

1. **Agent Loading**: Loads complete agent definition including dependencies
2. **Persona Adoption**: Transforms into specialized agent with unique behavior
3. **Capability Access**: Gains access to agent-specific tasks, templates, checklists
4. **Context Switching**: Maintains transformation state until explicitly exited

---

## 3. Workflow Orchestration System

### 3.1 Workflow Definition Structure

Workflows are defined in YAML with sequential agent steps:

```yaml
workflow:
  id: greenfield-fullstack
  name: "Greenfield Full-Stack Application Development"
  type: greenfield
  
  sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps: [brainstorming_session, market_research]
      
    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      
    # ... additional steps
```

### 3.2 Workflow Types

#### 3.2.1 Greenfield Workflows
- **greenfield-fullstack**: Complete application development
- **greenfield-service**: Backend service development
- **greenfield-ui**: Frontend-only development

#### 3.2.2 Brownfield Workflows
- **brownfield-fullstack**: Extending existing applications
- **brownfield-service**: Adding to existing services
- **brownfield-ui**: Frontend additions/modifications

### 3.3 Workflow Execution Patterns

**Sequential Processing**: Each step requires completion of previous steps
**Conditional Logic**: Steps can be conditional based on artifacts or user choices
**Validation Gates**: PO validation points ensure quality and consistency
**Handoff Prompts**: Structured communication between agents

Example handoff pattern:
```yaml
handoff_prompts:
  analyst_to_pm: "Project brief is complete. Save it as docs/project-brief.md, then create the PRD."
  pm_to_ux: "PRD is ready. Save it as docs/prd.md, then create the UI/UX specification."
```

---

## 4. Document and Task Management

### 4.1 Document Lifecycle

#### 4.1.1 Creation Phase
1. **Template Selection**: Agent selects appropriate template (e.g., `prd-tmpl.yaml`)
2. **Interactive Elicitation**: Template guides user through structured questioning
3. **Content Generation**: Agent populates template with gathered information
4. **Validation**: Built-in checklists ensure completeness

#### 4.1.2 Sharding Process
```yaml
# From prd configuration
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
epicFilePattern: epic-{n}*.md
```

**Sharding Strategy**:
- Large documents split into manageable pieces
- Epic-based organization for PRDs
- Section-based organization for architecture documents
- Maintains cross-references and dependencies

#### 4.1.3 Version Management
Documents include change logs and version tracking:
```yaml
changelog:
  title: Change Log
  type: table
  columns: [Date, Version, Description, Author]
```

### 4.2 Task Definition System

#### 4.2.1 Task Structure
Tasks are markdown files with structured sections:

```markdown
# Task Name

## Purpose
Clear description of task objectives

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution
Step-by-step execution instructions

### 1. Load Configuration
### 2. Gather Requirements
### 3. Process Information
### 4. Generate Output
```

#### 4.2.2 Key Task Types

**create-next-story**: Advanced story creation with context consolidation
- Loads core configuration
- Identifies next sequential story
- Gathers architecture context based on story type
- Consolidates information into self-contained story file

**execute-checklist**: Quality assurance execution
- Loads specified checklist
- Guides systematic validation
- Documents results and issues

**shard-doc**: Document sharding utility
- Splits large documents by sections/epics
- Maintains navigation and cross-references
- Creates structured directory hierarchies

### 4.3 Template System

#### 4.3.1 Template Architecture
Templates use YAML with embedded workflow logic:

```yaml
template:
  id: prd-template-v2
  name: Product Requirements Document
  output:
    format: markdown
    filename: docs/prd.md

workflow:
  mode: interactive
  elicitation: advanced-elicitation

sections:
  - id: goals-context
    instruction: |
      Detailed instructions for section completion
    elicit: true  # Requires user interaction
```

#### 4.3.2 Advanced Elicitation
Templates support sophisticated user interaction:
- **Pre-filling**: Smart defaults based on context
- **Conditional sections**: Show/hide based on responses
- **Choice validation**: Structured options for consistency
- **Example-driven guidance**: Concrete examples for clarity

---

## 5. Context Retrieval Architecture

### 5.1 Dynamic Loading Strategy

#### 5.1.1 Lazy Loading Principle
```yaml
# From orchestrator agent
loading:
  - KB: Only for *kb-mode or BMad questions
  - Agents: Only when transforming
  - Templates/Tasks: Only when executing
  - Always indicate loading
```

**Benefits**:
- Minimal memory footprint
- Faster agent activation
- Context-appropriate resource access
- Reduced cognitive load

#### 5.1.2 File Path Resolution
Standard pattern: `{root}/{type}/{name}`
- **{root}**: `.bmad-core` (IDE) or bundle root (web)
- **{type}**: Resource category (tasks, templates, checklists, data)
- **{name}**: File name with extension

### 5.2 Context Engineering for Development

#### 5.2.1 Story Context Consolidation
The `create-next-story` task implements sophisticated context engineering:

```markdown
### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Stories:** tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md

**For Backend/API Stories:** data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md

**For Frontend/UI Stories:** frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md
```

#### 5.2.2 Source Citation System
All technical details must include source references:
```
[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]
```

**Benefits**:
- Traceability of technical decisions
- Easy verification and updates
- Context preservation across iterations

### 5.3 Development Context Isolation

#### 5.3.1 Dev Agent Principles
```yaml
core_principles:
  - CRITICAL: Story has ALL info you will need aside from devLoadAlwaysFiles
  - CRITICAL: NEVER load PRD/architecture/other docs unless explicitly directed
  - CRITICAL: ONLY update story file Dev Agent Record sections
```

#### 5.3.2 DevLoadAlwaysFiles Mechanism
Provides minimal persistent context:
```yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md  
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md
```
