# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Sprint Task (MCP Enhanced)

## Purpose

Sprint-centric workflow enforcement that ensures all story development happens within the context of a defined sprint with clear goals and story targets. This task creates structured sprints that guide the entire development process.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE

**NO STORY CREATION WITHOUT ACTIVE SPRINT**: All story development must happen within an active sprint context. This ensures proper goal alignment and progress tracking.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Check MCP Availability and Current Sprint Status

**MCP Availability Check:**
- Verify MCP tools are available for the current project
- If MCP unavailable, warn user and suggest MCP setup
- If MCP available, proceed with enhanced workflow

**Current Sprint Check:**
1. Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to check for active sprint:
   - If active sprint exists: Ask user if they want to continue current sprint or start new one
   - If continuing: Show current sprint details and exit this task
   - If starting new: Ask user to confirm closing current sprint first

2. Use `bmad_get_project_progress` to understand current state:
   - Show overall project completion
   - Display any incomplete tasks that should be addressed

### 1. Sprint Planning and Goal Definition

#### 1.1 Gather Sprint Information

**Interactive Sprint Creation Process:**

1. **Sprint Name:** Ask user for sprint name:
   ```
   Sprint name (e.g., "User Authentication Sprint", "Core Features Sprint"):
   ```

2. **Sprint Goal:** Ask user for clear, measurable sprint goal:
   ```
   Sprint Goal - What specific outcome should this sprint achieve?
   (Example: "Complete user authentication system with registration, login, and password reset")
   ```

3. **Sprint Duration:** Ask user for sprint timeframe:
   ```
   Sprint duration:
   1. 1 Week Sprint
   2. 2 Week Sprint  
   3. 3 Week Sprint
   4. Custom duration
   ```

4. **Target Stories:** Ask user to define which stories/epics to include:
   ```
   Which Epic(s) should this sprint focus on?
   Available Epics: [List from bmad_query_epics]
   
   Target Epic Number(s): (e.g., "1" or "1,2")
   ```

#### 1.2 Analyze Epic and Story Context

**MCP-Enhanced Context Gathering:**

1. **Get Epic Information:** Use MCP to understand epic scope:
   - `bmad_query_epics` - Get all available epics
   - For each target epic: Use `bmad://epics/<num>/tasks` to see existing stories
   - Use `bmad://epics/<num>/progress` to understand completion status

2. **Story Planning:** Help user define story targets:
   - Show existing stories in target epic(s)
   - Calculate how many new stories are needed
   - Estimate sprint capacity based on story complexity

3. **Dependencies Analysis:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` to check:
   - Any blocked or in-progress tasks that need completion
   - Dependencies between epics that might affect sprint scope

#### 1.3 Define Sprint Scope and Stories

**Sprint Story Planning:**

1. **Story List Creation:** Work with user to define specific stories for sprint:
   ```
   Sprint Stories Plan:
   Epic ${epic_num}.${next_story} - [Story Title]
   Epic ${epic_num}.${next_story+1} - [Story Title]
   ...
   
   Total Estimated Stories: X
   Sprint Capacity Check: Does this seem achievable in ${duration}?
   ```

2. **Acceptance Criteria for Sprint:** Define sprint success criteria:
   - Which stories must be DONE for sprint success
   - Which stories are stretch goals
   - What deliverables should be ready for demo

### 2. Create Sprint via MCP Tools

#### 2.1 Sprint Creation

**MCP Tool Usage:**

1. **Create the Sprint:** Use `bmad_create_sprint` tool:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "<sprint_name>",
     "goal": "<detailed_sprint_goal>", 
     "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
     "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
     "target_epics": [1, 2],
     "story_targets": ["E1.3", "E1.4", "E2.1"],
     "success_criteria": "<what defines sprint success>"
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Sprint Creation:** Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to confirm:
   - Sprint was created successfully
   - Sprint status is ACTIVE
   - All metadata is correct

#### 2.2 Sprint Documentation

**Enhanced Sprint Record:**

1. **Sprint Planning Document:** Create comprehensive sprint plan:
   - Sprint goal and success criteria
   - Target epic(s) and story breakdown
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

2. **Store via MCP:** Use `bmad_create_document` to save sprint plan:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "sprint-plan",
     "title": "Sprint ${sprint_num} Plan - ${sprint_name}",
     "content": "<detailed_sprint_plan_markdown>",
     "metadata": {
       "sprint_id": "<sprint_id>",
       "target_epics": [1, 2],
       "duration_weeks": 2
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. Initialize Sprint Backlog

#### 3.1 Story Preparation

**Sprint Backlog Setup:**

1. **Identify Existing Stories:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` to find stories in target epics:
   - Filter by epic numbers defined in sprint scope
   - Show current status of each story
   - Prioritize which stories to include in sprint backlog

2. **Mark Stories for Sprint:** For each story to include in sprint:
   - Use `bmad_update_task_status` to assign to current sprint
   - Set priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on sprint goals
   - Update assignee to appropriate agent (usually 'dev')

3. **Sprint Capacity Check:** Validate sprint scope:
   - Count total stories assigned to sprint
   - Estimate total effort based on story complexity
   - Confirm with user that scope is realistic

#### 3.2 Sprint Tracking Setup

**Progress Tracking Configuration:**

1. **Sprint Dashboard:** Set up sprint tracking:
   - Sprint goal and timeline visibility
   - Story completion tracking
   - Burndown/burnup chart preparation

2. **Sprint Metrics:** Define what to track:
   - Story completion rate
   - Sprint velocity (stories per week)
   - Goal achievement progress
   - Impediment tracking

### 4. Sprint Kickoff and Communication

#### 4.1 Sprint Summary

**Sprint Kickoff Information:**

1. **Display Sprint Details:**
   ```
   üèÉ SPRINT CREATED SUCCESSFULLY üèÉ
   
   Sprint: ${sprint_name}
   Goal: ${sprint_goal}
   Duration: ${start_date} to ${end_date}
   Target Epics: ${epic_list}
   
   Success Criteria:
   - ${criteria_1}  
   - ${criteria_2}
   
   Sprint Backlog: ${story_count} stories
   ${story_list}
   ```

2. **Next Steps Guidance:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Sprint is now ACTIVE
   ‚úÖ Backlog is prepared  
   ‚úÖ Stories are assigned
   
   Next Actions:
   1. Use *draft-mcp command to create detailed stories
   2. Begin development with dev agent
   3. Track progress via task board (sprint-filtered)
   4. Review sprint goal regularly
   ```

#### 4.2 Sprint Enforcement Rules

**Workflow Rules Activation:**

1. **Story Creation Rules:** From now on:
   - All new stories MUST be created within sprint context
   - Stories automatically assigned to current sprint
   - Story creation checks sprint capacity

2. **Sprint Boundary Enforcement:**
   - Task board shows only current sprint tasks
   - Progress tracking filtered to sprint scope
   - All agents aware of sprint context and goals

### 5. Integration with Story Creation

#### 5.1 Enhanced Story Creation Context

**Sprint-Aware Story Creation:**

When `create-next-story-mcp.md` is executed after sprint creation:

1. **Automatic Sprint Assignment:** New stories automatically get:
   - Current sprint ID assigned
   - Sprint goal context included in description
   - Priority aligned with sprint objectives

2. **Sprint Capacity Checks:** Before creating stories:
   - Check remaining sprint capacity
   - Warn if adding story might exceed sprint scope
   - Suggest moving to next sprint if current is full

3. **Goal Alignment Validation:** Each story gets:
   - Sprint goal context in story description
   - Acceptance criteria aligned with sprint success criteria
   - Clear connection to sprint deliverables

#### 5.2 Sprint Progress Integration

**Real-Time Sprint Tracking:**

1. **Sprint Dashboard Updates:** After sprint creation:
   - Task board filters to current sprint only
   - Progress charts show sprint-specific metrics
   - Goal achievement tracking activated

2. **Sprint-Aware Reporting:** All progress reports include:
   - Sprint timeline and goal progress
   - Story completion toward sprint success
   - Sprint velocity and burndown metrics

## Sprint Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Goal Achievement:** Did sprint deliver on its stated goal?
2. **Story Completion:** What percentage of planned stories were completed?
3. **Sprint Velocity:** How many stories per week were completed?
4. **Quality Metrics:** Were stories completed to definition of done?

### Sprint Review Preparation

After sprint creation, prepare for sprint review:
1. Demo-ready deliverables from completed stories
2. Sprint goal achievement assessment  
3. Lessons learned and retrospective items
4. Input for next sprint planning

## MCP Tools Reference

### Required Tools:
- `bmad_create_sprint` - Create new sprint with goal and timeline
- `bmad_get_current_sprint` - Check for active sprint

# Create Next Story Task (MCP Enhanced)

## Purpose

Enhanced story creation using MCP tools for structured data management and querying. This task uses MCP tools to track project state and provides real-time insights into story progress.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Check MCP Availability and Sprint Status

**MCP Availability Check:**
- Check if MCP tools are available for the current project
- If MCP unavailable, fall back to file-based operation with warning
- If MCP available, use MCP tools for enhanced workflow

**CRITICAL: Sprint Requirement Check:**
1. Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to verify active sprint exists:
   - If NO active sprint: **STOP** and display error:
     ```
     ‚ùå ERROR: No Active Sprint Found
     
     Story creation requires an active sprint with defined goals.
     
     Next Steps:
     1. Run *start-sprint command to create a new sprint
     2. Define sprint goal and target stories
     3. Then return to create individual stories
     
     Reason: All stories must align with sprint goals for proper tracking.
     ```
   - If active sprint exists: Continue with story creation

2. Display current sprint context:
   ```
   üèÉ Current Sprint: ${sprint_name}
   üìÖ Sprint Goal: ${sprint_goal}
   ‚è∞ Sprint Timeline: ${start_date} to ${end_date}
   üìä Sprint Progress: ${completed_stories}/${total_stories} stories
   ```

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Query Tasks for Current Story Status

**MCP-Enhanced Approach:**

1. Use MCP tool `bmad_query_tasks` to check for incomplete tasks:
   - Query all tasks with status "TODO" or "IN_PROGRESS" 
   - If incomplete tasks found, alert user and ask to proceed or fix first
   - Use `bmad_get_project_progress` to get overview

2. Determine which epic to work on:
   - Ask user which epic number they want to work on
   - Use `bmad_query_tasks` with epic filter to see existing stories
   - Calculate next story number based on highest existing story in that epic

3. Interactive decision making:
   - If incomplete story found: Ask user "Fix this story first, or accept risk & override to create next?"
   - If proceeding: Select next sequential story in the current epic

**Example MCP Tool Usage:**
- `bmad_query_tasks`: `{"status": "TODO"}` - Get incomplete tasks
- `bmad_query_tasks`: `{"epic_num": 1}` - Get all stories in Epic 1  
- `bmad_get_project_progress`: `{}` - Get overall project status

**MCP Requirement:**
If MCP tools unavailable, inform user that MCP server is required for story creation

### 2. Gather Requirements and Context

#### 2.1 Retrieve Epic and Architecture Information

**MCP-Enhanced Approach:**

1. **Access PRD and Architecture:** Use MCP resources to get context documents:
   - `bmad://project/prd` - Get Product Requirements Document
   - `bmad://project/architecture` - Get System Architecture Document  
   - `bmad://project/info` - Get project metadata and overview

2. **Epic Information:** Look for epic documents or extract epic context from PRD:
   - Read relevant sections of PRD that correspond to the target epic
   - Extract epic-specific requirements and acceptance criteria

**Example MCP Resource Usage:**
- Access `bmad://project/prd` to read the full PRD
- Access `bmad://project/architecture` to read architecture constraints
- Access `bmad://project/info` to understand project structure

#### 2.2 Analyze Previous Story Context

**MCP-Enhanced Approach:**

1. **Get Completed Stories:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` to analyze previous work:
   - Query: `{"epic_num": <current_epic>, "status": "DONE"}` 
   - Review last completed story for implementation patterns
   - Extract lessons learned and technical decisions

2. **Epic Progress Analysis:** Use `bmad://epics/<epic_num>/progress` resource:
   - Get completion percentage and remaining work
   - Understand what components are already built
   - Identify dependencies and integration points

**Example Queries:**
- `bmad_query_tasks`: `{"epic_num": 1, "status": "DONE"}` - Get completed stories in Epic 1
- Access `bmad://epics/1/tasks` - Get all tasks in Epic 1
- Access `bmad://epics/1/progress` - Get Epic 1 progress statistics

### 3. Create Story with Enhanced Context

#### 3.1 Gather Story Information

**Interactive Story Creation Process:**

1. **Story Title:** Ask user for story title:
   ```
   Story ${currentEpicNum}.${nextStoryNum} title:
   ```

2. **Story Description:** Ask user for detailed description including:
   - User story format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Any special requirements or constraints

3. **Story Metadata:** Collect story properties:
   - Priority: High/Medium/Low  
   - Assignee: Usually 'dev'
   - Estimated hours (optional)

#### 3.2 Create Story Task via MCP Tools

**MCP Tool Usage:**

1. **Create the Story:** Use `bmad_create_story` tool:
   ```json
   {
     "epic_num": <current_epic_num>,
     "title": "<story_title>", 
     "description": "<detailed_description>",
     "assignee": "dev",
     "priority": "<HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW>"
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Creation:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` to confirm story was created:
   ```json
   {
     "epic_num": <current_epic_num>,
     "story_num": <next_story_num>
   }
   ```

**Enhanced Context Integration:**
- Include relevant PRD sections in description
- Reference architecture constraints and patterns
- Note dependencies on previous stories
- Add technical notes from architecture analysis

### 4. Generate Story Document (Optional)

**File-Based Compatibility:**

If your project still uses file-based story management, you can optionally create a markdown file using the story template:

1. Load `story-tmpl.yaml` template from templates directory
2. Populate with story data from MCP database  
3. Save to configured `devStoryLocation`

**Template Variables:**
- `epic_num`, `story_num`, `title`, `description`
- `status`, `assignee`, `priority`
- `acceptance_criteria`, `technical_notes`
- `created_date`

### 5. Update Sprint Planning (If Applicable)

**Sprint Management via MCP:**

1. **Check Active Sprint:** No specific MCP resource for sprints yet, but you can:
   - Ask user if there's an active sprint
   - If yes, note the sprint name for documentation

2. **Story Assignment:** The story is already created in TODO status and ready for dev assignment

3. **Capacity Planning:** Use project progress data to understand current workload

### 6. Summary and Next Steps

**Progress Summary via MCP Resources:**

1. **Display Story Creation Results:**
   - Show created story: `Epic ${epic_num}.${story_num} - ${title}`
   - Display task ID and status
   - Show assignee and priority

2. **Epic Progress Overview:** Use `bmad://epics/${epic_num}/progress` resource:
   - Show total stories in epic
   - Display completion percentage  
   - List remaining work

3. **Project Overview:** Use `bmad://project/progress` resource:
   - Show overall project completion
   - Display task breakdown by status

**Next Steps:**
1. Review story details with stakeholders  
2. Assign to development agent for implementation
3. Begin development workflow
4. Track progress via MCP tools

## Enhanced Benefits

   ```
   üìà SPRINT VELOCITY METRICS üìà
   
   Stories Completed: ${completed_stories}
   Sprint Duration: ${duration_weeks} weeks
   Sprint Velocity: ${stories_per_week} stories/week
   
   Historical Comparison:
   Previous Sprint Velocity: ${previous_velocity}
   Velocity Change: ${velocity_change} (+/- ${percentage}%)
   ```

2. **Velocity Trend Analysis:**
   - Is velocity increasing, decreasing, or stable?
   - What factors influenced velocity changes?
   - What does this suggest for future sprint planning?

#### 3.2 Documentation Creation

**Sprint Closure Documentation:**

1. **Create Sprint Review Document:** Use `bmad_create_document`:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "sprint-review",
     "title": "Sprint ${sprint_num} Review - ${sprint_name}",
     "content": {
       "sprint_info": {
         "name": "${sprint_name}",
         "goal": "${sprint_goal}",
         "duration": "${start_date} to ${end_date}"
       },
       "goal_achievement": {
         "level": "${achievement_level}",
         "explanation": "${achievement_explanation}"
       },
       "completion_metrics": {
         "planned_stories": ${planned_count},
         "completed_stories": ${completed_count},
         "completion_rate": "${completion_percentage}%",
         "velocity": "${sprint_velocity}"
       },
       "retrospective": {
         "went_well": ["${item1}", "${item2}", "${item3}"],
         "improvements": ["${item1}", "${item2}", "${item3}"],

       },
       "incomplete_stories": ["${story1}", "${story2}"],
       "lessons_learned": "${lessons_text}"
     }
   }
   ```

### 4. Sprint Status Update and Closure

#### 4.1 Handle Incomplete Stories

**Story Transition Management:**

1. **Process Incomplete Stories:** For each incomplete story:
   - Update story status if moving to next sprint
   - Add notes explaining why story wasn't completed
   - Estimate remaining effort for next sprint planning

2. **Use MCP Tools for Updates:**
   ```json
   bmad_update_task_status:
   {
     "task_id": "${story_id}",
     "status": "TODO",
     "notes": "Moved from Sprint ${current_sprint} - ${reason}",
     "sprint_id": null
   }
   ```

#### 4.2 Close Sprint Officially

**Sprint Closure Process:**

1. **Update Sprint Status:** Use `bmad_update_sprint_status`:
   ```json
   {
     "sprint_id": "${current_sprint_id}",
     "status": "COMPLETED",
     "end_date": "${actual_end_date}",
     "goal_achievement": "${achievement_level}",
     "completion_rate": "${completion_percentage}%",
     "velocity": "${sprint_velocity}",
     "lessons_learned": "${retrospective_summary}"
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Closure:** Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to confirm:
   - Sprint status changed to COMPLETED
   - No longer shows as current/active sprint
   - All data properly recorded

# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary

   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:

   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)

   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work down and not create a mess.]]

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | _TBD_  |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | _TBD_  |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | _TBD_  |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | _TBD_  |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | _TBD_  |        |

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
- NEEDS REVISION: The story requires updates (see issues)
- BLOCKED: External information required (specify what information)
