# Create Document from Template (MCP Enhanced)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

This MCP-enhanced version provides structured document storage and tracking with interactive workflow requirements.

## MCP Availability Check

**Initial Setup:**
Ask the user if they have MCP tools available. If they respond yes, use MCP-enhanced workflow. If no, inform the user that MCP tools are required for this enhanced workflow.

## MCP-Enhanced Document Creation Flow

### 0. MCP Context Setup

**Project Context Loading:**
1. Use `bmad://project/info` resource to get project metadata
2. Check if project has existing documents of the same type
3. Use `bmad_create_document` tool for structured storage

### 1. Template Discovery and Document Planning

**Enhanced Template Selection:**
- Load template from traditional file system (templates still file-based)
- Use `bmad://project/info` to understand project context for template customization
- Check for existing similar documents via MCP resources

**Document Initialization:**
1. **Document Metadata Setup:**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "prd|architecture|epic|story",
     "title": "<document_title>",
     "status": "DRAFT",
     "version": "1.0"
   }
   ```

2. **MCP Document Creation:** Use `bmad_create_document` tool:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "<doc_type>",
     "title": "<document_title>", 
     "content": "<initial_content>",
     "status": "DRAFT"
   }
   ```

### 2. Interactive Section Processing

**Enhanced Section Workflow:**

**For Each Template Section:**

1. **Context Enhancement:** Before processing section, gather relevant context:
   - Use `bmad://project/prd` or `bmad://project/architecture` to reference existing docs
   - Use `bmad://project/progress` to understand current project state
   - Use `bmad_query_tasks` to understand implementation context

2. **Interactive Processing (Maintaining Original Requirements):**
   - Draft content using section instruction + MCP context
   - Present content + detailed rationale (including MCP insights)
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format (unchanged from original)
   - Wait for user response and process feedback

3. **MCP Storage:** After each section is approved:
   - Update document content via `bmad_create_document` tool
   - Maintain version history and change tracking
   - Store section metadata for future reference

### 3. Enhanced Rationale with MCP Insights

**When presenting section content, include:**

- **Traditional rationale** (trade-offs, assumptions, decisions)
- **Project context insights** from `bmad://project/info`
- **Cross-reference insights** from existing documents
- **Implementation readiness** based on current project progress
- **Dependency analysis** from task database

**Example Enhanced Rationale:**
```
SECTION: Product Overview
CONTENT: [Generated content]

RATIONALE:
- Trade-offs: Chose mobile-first approach over desktop due to user research
- Assumptions: Assuming React/Node.js stack based on project architecture
- MCP Insights: Project is 45% complete with 3 active epics in progress
- Cross-references: Aligns with existing architecture document section 3.2
- Dependencies: No blocking tasks for this feature scope

[Standard 1-9 elicitation options...]
```

### 4. Document Completion and Storage

**MCP-Enhanced Completion:**

1. **Final Document Assembly:**
   - Compile all sections into complete document
   - Update document status from DRAFT to FINAL
   - Store complete document via `bmad_create_document`

2. **Cross-Reference Updates:**
   - Link to related documents in project database
   - Update project metadata if this is a primary document (PRD/Architecture)
   - Create any necessary epic records if document defines epics

3. **File System Sync:** 
   - Save document to traditional file location for backwards compatibility
   - Maintain both MCP database and file system versions

### 5. Project Integration

**Enhanced Project Workflow:**

**For PRD Documents:**
1. Use `bmad_create_document` with type="prd"
2. Extract and create epic records using `bmad_create_epic`
3. Update project metadata to reference new PRD

**For Architecture Documents:**
1. Use `bmad_create_document` with type="architecture" 
2. Update project technical constraints and specifications
3. Link to relevant epics and stories for implementation tracking

**For Epic/Story Documents:**
1. Create structured epic/story records in database
2. Link to parent PRD or requirements documents
3. Enable tracking and progress monitoring

### 6. Enhanced Benefits

**MCP Integration Advantages:**

1. **Document Versioning:** Automatic version tracking and history
2. **Cross-Reference Integrity:** Links between documents maintained automatically
3. **Progress Tracking:** Document creation integrated with project progress
4. **Search and Discovery:** Documents accessible via MCP resources
5. **Collaborative Updates:** Multiple agents can reference and update documents

**Real-Time Context:**
- **Live Progress Data:** Access current sprint/epic progress during document creation
- **Implementation Feedback:** Reference actual development progress when planning
- **Resource Availability:** Check what components/features already exist

## Elicitation with MCP Context

**Enhanced Elicitation Methods:**

When user selects elicitation options 2-9, enhance with MCP data:

- **Stakeholder Analysis:** Include current project stakeholders from MCP
- **Risk Assessment:** Factor in current project risks and blockers from task database
- **Feasibility Check:** Cross-reference with current architecture and capabilities
- **Impact Analysis:** Consider effects on existing epics and stories
- **Timeline Estimation:** Use historical project data for realistic planning

## Fallback Strategy

**If MCP tools unavailable:**
1. Display warning: "MCP tools not available, document creation requires MCP server"
2. Inform user that MCP server setup is required for document management
3. Provide instructions for enabling MCP server
4. Do not proceed without MCP tools

**MCP Requirements:**
- All documents created in MCP database with optional file export
- MCP server must be running for enhanced document management
- Enhanced features require MCP integration

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**Core workflow requirements:**

1. **MANDATORY ELICITATION FORMAT** - 1-9 numbered options when elicit=true
2. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Full user interaction required for elicit sections
3. **SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING** - Each section processed step-by-step
4. **DETAILED RATIONALE** - Explain all trade-offs and decisions

**MCP enhancements supplement but do not replace these core requirements.**

# Create Brownfield Story Task (MCP Enhanced)

## Purpose

Create a single user story for very small brownfield enhancements using MCP tools for real-time project integration. This MCP-enhanced version provides automated story numbering, sprint assignment, and existing system context awareness.

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**

- The enhancement can be completed in a single story
- No new architecture or significant design is required
- The change follows existing patterns exactly
- Integration is straightforward with minimal risk
- Change is isolated with clear boundaries

**Use brownfield-create-epic-mcp when:**

- The enhancement requires 2-3 coordinated stories
- Some design work is needed
- Multiple integration points are involved

**Use the full brownfield PRD/Architecture process when:**

- The enhancement requires multiple coordinated stories
- Architectural planning is needed
- Significant integration work is required

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution

### 0. MCP Availability and Sprint Requirement Check

**MCP Availability Check:**
- Verify MCP tools are available for the current project
- If MCP unavailable, fall back to file-based operation with warning
- If MCP available, use enhanced workflow with real-time integration

**CRITICAL: Sprint Requirement Check:**
1. Use `bmad_get_current_sprint` to verify active sprint exists:
   - If NO active sprint: **STOP** and display error:
     ```
     ‚ùå ERROR: No Active Sprint Found
     
     Story creation requires an active sprint with defined goals.
     
     Next Steps:
     1. Run SM agent *start-sprint command to create a new sprint
     2. Define sprint goal and capacity
     3. Then return to create individual stories
     
     Reason: All stories must align with sprint goals for proper tracking.
     ```
   - If active sprint exists: Continue with story creation

2. Display current sprint context:
   ```
   üèÉ Current Sprint: ${sprint_name}
   üìÖ Sprint Goal: ${sprint_goal}
   ‚è∞ Sprint Timeline: ${start_date} to ${end_date}

- `bmad_link_entity_to_document` - Link shards to epics and stories
- `bmad_query_epics` - Align shards with existing epics
- `bmad_get_project_progress` - Understand project context for sharding
- Document queries - Access and analyze source documents

### Enhanced Resources:
- `bmad://documents/shards` - All document shards and their relationships
- `bmad://epics/<num>/shards` - Shards associated with specific epics
- `bmad://shards/<id>/stories` - Stories created from specific shards

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Context Preservation:** Maintain sufficient context in each shard for development use
2. **Epic Alignment:** Ensure shards align with epic scope and development sequence
3. **Development Readiness:** Size and structure shards for optimal story creation
4. **Relationship Management:** Maintain clear links between shards and development entities
5. **Navigation Support:** Provide clear index and navigation between related shards

This MCP-enhanced approach ensures document sharding supports structured development workflows with proper tracking and relationship management throughout the development process.

      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first using project-brief-tmpl (it provides essential foundation: problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, constraints). If user insists on PRD without brief, gather this information during Goals section. If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired outcomes) and Background Context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for PRD mvp. Either way this is critical to determine the requirements. Include Change Log table.

      1. Check if .bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml or an attached technical-preferences file exists - use it to pre-populate choices
      2. Ask user about: languages, frameworks, starter templates, libraries, APIs, deployment targets
      3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
      4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the project)
      5. These become constraints for the Architect - be specific and complete

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.
      
      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:
      
      - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations"
      - "Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes"

  - id: epic-details
    title: Epic {{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}

      After the epic list is approved, present each epic with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit.
      
      For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve).
      
      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:
      
      - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
      - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
      - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
      - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
      - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
      - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
      - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
      - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
      - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice

    instruction: |
      IMPORTANT - SCOPE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:
      
      This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing projects that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. Before proceeding:
      
      1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: If this is a simple feature addition or bug fix that could be completed in 1-2 focused development sessions, STOP and recommend: "For simpler changes, consider using the brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story task with the Product Owner instead. This full PRD process is designed for substantial enhancements that require architectural planning and multiple coordinated stories."
      
      2. **Project Context**: Determine if we're working in an IDE with the project already loaded or if the user needs to provide project information. If project files are available, analyze existing documentation in the docs folder. If insufficient documentation exists, recommend running the document-project task first.
      
      3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing project structure, patterns, and constraints before making ANY suggestions. Every recommendation must be grounded in actual project analysis, not assumptions.
      
      Gather comprehensive information about the existing project. This section must be completed before proceeding with requirements.
      
      CRITICAL: Throughout this analysis, explicitly confirm your understanding with the user. For every assumption you make about the existing project, ask: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"
      
      Do not proceed with any recommendations until the user has validated your understanding of the existing system.

# Product Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development. The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PM CHECKLIST

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. prd.md - The Product Requirements Document (check docs/prd.md)
2. Any user research, market analysis, or competitive analysis documents
3. Business goals and strategy documents
4. Any existing epic definitions or user stories

IMPORTANT: If the PRD is missing, immediately ask the user for its location or content before proceeding.

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. User-Centric - Every requirement should tie back to user value
2. MVP Focus - Ensure scope is truly minimal while viable
3. Clarity - Requirements should be unambiguous and testable
4. Completeness - All aspects of the product vision are covered
5. Feasibility - Requirements are technically achievable

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

==================== END: .bmad-core/checklists/pm-checklist.md ====================

==================== START: .bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist.md ====================
# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMad workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes during development are inevitable, but how we handle them determines project success or failure.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes that affect the project direction
2. Minor adjustments within a story don't require this process
3. The goal is to minimize wasted work while adapting to new realities
4. User buy-in is critical - they must understand and approve changes

Required context:

- The triggering story or issue
- Current project state (completed stories, current epic)
- Access to PRD, architecture, and other key documents
- Understanding of remaining work planned

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process with the user. Work through each section together, discussing implications and options. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert guidance on technical feasibility and impact.

REMEMBER: Changes are opportunities to improve, not failures. Handle them professionally and constructively.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by fully understanding what went wrong and why. Don't jump to solutions yet. Ask probing questions:

- What exactly happened that triggered this review?
- Is this a one-time issue or symptomatic of a larger problem?
- Could this have been anticipated earlier?
- What assumptions were incorrect?

Be specific and factual, not blame-oriented.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

[[LLM: Changes ripple through the project structure. Systematically evaluate:

1. Can we salvage the current epic with modifications?
2. Do future epics still make sense given this change?
3. Are we creating or eliminating dependencies?
4. Does the epic sequence need reordering?

Think about both immediate and downstream effects.]]

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Documentation drives development in BMad. Check each artifact:

1. Does this change invalidate documented decisions?
2. Are architectural assumptions still valid?
3. Do user flows need rethinking?
4. Are technical constraints different than documented?

Be thorough - missed conflicts cause future problems.]]

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present options clearly with pros/cons. For each path:

1. What's the effort required?
2. What work gets thrown away?
3. What risks are we taking?
4. How does this affect timeline?
5. Is this sustainable long-term?

Be honest about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must be actionable and clear. Ensure:

1. The issue is explained in plain language
2. Impacts are quantified where possible
3. The recommended path has clear rationale
4. Next steps are specific and assigned
5. Success criteria for the change are defined

This proposal guides all subsequent work.]]

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **Identified Issue Summary:** Clear, concise problem statement.
- [ ] **Epic Impact Summary:** How epics are affected.
- [ ] **Artifact Adjustment Needs:** List of documents to change.
- [ ] **Recommended Path Forward:** Chosen solution with rationale.
- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Changes require coordination. Before concluding:

1. Is the user fully aligned with the plan?
2. Do all stakeholders understand the impacts?
3. Are handoffs to other agents clear?
4. Is there a rollback plan if the change fails?
5. How will we validate the change worked?

Get explicit approval - implicit agreement causes problems.

FINAL REPORT:
After completing the checklist, provide a concise summary:

- What changed and why
- What we're doing about it
- Who needs to do what
- When we'll know if it worked

Keep it action-oriented and forward-looking.]]

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.
