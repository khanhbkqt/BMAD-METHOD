# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Validate Next Story Task (MCP Enhanced)

## Purpose

Enhanced story validation using MCP tools for data access and cross-referencing. This task validates story completeness and readiness using structured data from the MCP server while providing fallback to file-based validation.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Check MCP Availability and Load Context

**MCP Availability Check:**
Ask the user if they have MCP tools available. If they respond yes, use MCP workflow. If no, inform user that MCP server is required for validation.

**MCP-Enhanced Context Loading:**
1. Use `bmad://project/info` resource to get project configuration
2. Use `bmad_query_tasks` to identify the story to validate
3. Access story details from MCP database if available

### 1. Story Identification and Loading

**MCP-Enhanced Approach:**

1. **Story Selection:** If story ID not provided, use `bmad_query_tasks` to list recent stories:
   - Query: `{"status": "TODO", "assignee": "dev"}` - Get dev-assigned stories
   - Present list to user for selection

2. **Story Details:** Load story from MCP database:
   - Get complete story details including title, description, tasks
   - Access any metadata and creation context
   - Check story status and assignment

**Example Queries:**
- `bmad_query_tasks`: `{"id": "<story_id>"}` - Get specific story details
- `bmad_query_tasks`: `{"epic_num": 1, "story_num": 2}` - Get story by epic/story number

### 2. Template Completeness Validation

**MCP-Enhanced Validation:**

1. **Template Access:** Load story template from file system (template still file-based)
2. **Story Structure:** Validate story contains all required sections
3. **Database Consistency:** Verify story data in database matches expected structure

**Validation Points:**
- Check story has title, description, acceptance criteria
- Verify tasks/subtasks are properly structured  
- Ensure metadata fields are populated correctly
- Validate status tracking fields exist

### 3. Context and Dependency Validation  

**MCP-Enhanced Context Access:**

1. **Epic Context:** Use `bmad://epics/<epic_num>/tasks` to get epic context:
   - Verify story fits within epic scope
   - Check dependencies on other stories in epic
   - Validate epic requirements coverage

2. **Architecture Alignment:** Use `bmad://project/architecture` resource:
   - Verify technical approaches align with architecture
   - Check component and file path specifications
   - Validate integration patterns

3. **PRD Alignment:** Use `bmad://project/prd` resource:
   - Ensure story requirements match PRD specifications
   - Verify functional requirements coverage
   - Check business value alignment

**Example Resource Access:**
- Access `bmad://epics/1/tasks` - Get all tasks in Epic 1 for dependency analysis
- Access `bmad://project/architecture` - Validate technical specifications
- Access `bmad://project/prd` - Cross-reference business requirements

### 4. Implementation Readiness Assessment

**MCP-Enhanced Readiness Checks:**

1. **Previous Story Analysis:** Use `bmad_query_tasks` to check story sequence:
   - Query: `{"epic_num": <epic>, "status": "DONE"}` - Get completed stories
   - Verify dependencies are satisfied
   - Check if prerequisite stories are complete

2. **Resource Availability:** Check if all referenced resources exist:
   - Verify architecture documents are accessible
   - Confirm PRD sections are available
   - Validate template and configuration files

3. **Task Granularity:** Analyze story tasks for implementability:
   - Check task clarity and actionability
   - Verify technical specifications completeness
   - Assess testing requirements coverage

### 5. Anti-Hallucination Verification

**MCP-Enhanced Source Verification:**

1. **Architecture Cross-Reference:** Compare story details against architecture:
   - Use `bmad://project/architecture` to verify technical claims
   - Check file paths and component specifications
   - Validate API and database references

2. **PRD Requirements Mapping:** Verify requirements traceability:
   - Use `bmad://project/prd` to confirm requirement coverage
   - Check acceptance criteria alignment
   - Validate business logic specifications

3. **Epic Consistency:** Use epic tasks to check consistency:
   - Compare similar stories for pattern consistency
   - Verify naming conventions and approaches
   - Check for contradictions with previous implementations

### 6. Quality and Completeness Assessment

**MCP-Enhanced Quality Checks:**

1. **Progress Context:** Use `bmad://project/progress` to assess project context:
   - Check overall project completion status
   - Understand current velocity and capacity
   - Assess story complexity relative to progress

2. **Epic Progress:** Use `bmad://epics/<epic_num>/progress`:
   - Verify story fits epic timeline
   - Check epic completion percentage
   - Assess story priority and sequencing

### 7. Generate Validation Report

**MCP-Enhanced Reporting:**

Provide a structured validation report with MCP data integration:

#### MCP Data Summary
- **Story ID**: Database ID and epic.story number
- **Creation Date**: When story was created
- **Current Status**: TODO/IN_PROGRESS/etc.
- **Epic Context**: Progress and related stories
- **Project Context**: Overall progress percentage

#### Template Compliance Issues
- Missing required fields in database record
- Incomplete story structure or metadata
- Missing task definitions or acceptance criteria

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)
- **Architecture Misalignment**: Technical details contradicting architecture docs
- **Missing Dependencies**: Required previous stories not completed
- **Resource Unavailability**: Referenced documents or configurations missing
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Essential details missing from PRD cross-reference

#### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)
- **Context Gaps**: Missing technical context from architecture
- **Testing Inadequacy**: Insufficient test specification
- **Task Sequencing**: Suboptimal implementation order
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing references or explanations

#### Anti-Hallucination Findings
- **Unverified Claims**: Technical details not found in architecture docs
- **PRD Misalignment**: Requirements not matching PRD specifications  
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Approaches differing from similar completed stories
- **Missing Source References**: Claims without traceable sources

#### MCP Data Insights
- **Epic Progress**: X% complete, Y stories remaining
- **Project Velocity**: Average completion time based on historical data
- **Dependency Status**: All prerequisite stories completed/blocked
- **Resource Availability**: All required documents accessible

#### Final Assessment
- **GO/NO-GO**: Implementation readiness decision
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 based on MCP data analysis
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low with supporting MCP evidence
- **Recommended Actions**: Specific fixes based on MCP data analysis

## Enhanced Benefits

### Real-Time Context
- **Live Progress**: Access current project and epic status
- **Dependency Tracking**: Real-time status of prerequisite stories
- **Resource Validation**: Immediate verification of document availability

### Data-Driven Insights  
- **Pattern Analysis**: Compare against similar completed stories
